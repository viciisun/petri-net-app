# Petri Net Visualization Issue Fix Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Isolated Node Display Issue

**Problem**: Isolated places/transitions in PNML files were not displayed in visualization

**Cause**: Layout algorithms (Dagre/Elkjs) may ignore isolated nodes without connections

**Fix**:

- Added special handling logic for isolated nodes in `layoutService.js`
- Ensured all nodes are included in layout, isolated nodes are placed in separate positions

### 2. Final Marking Recognition Issue

**Problem**: Unable to correctly identify and display final marking nodes

**Cause**: Backend PM4Py service completely ignored the `final_marking` parameter

**Fix**:

- Modified `backend/app/models/petri_net.py`: Added `isFinalMarking` field
- Modified `backend/app/services/pm4py_service.py`:
  - Added `final_marking` parameter to `_convert_to_react_flow` method
  - Parse final marking information and mark corresponding places
- Modified `frontend/src/services/layoutService.js`: Correctly pass final marking information

### 3. Node ID and Name Mismatch Issue

**Problem**: Node IDs and names were inconsistent with those in PNML files

**Cause**: Incorrect understanding of PM4Py object properties

**Fix**:

- Discovered correct PM4Py property structure through testing:
  - Place: `place.name` is ID, `place.properties['place_name_tag']` is display name
  - Transition: `transition.name` is ID, `transition.label` is display name
- Modified backend service to correctly use these properties
- Updated data model to include `name` field

## Modified Files

### Backend Files

1. **`backend/app/models/petri_net.py`**

   - Added `name`, `isInitialMarking`, `isFinalMarking` fields to NodeData model

2. **`backend/app/services/pm4py_service.py`**
   - Modified `_convert_to_react_flow` method signature, added `final_marking` parameter
   - Correctly parse place and transition IDs and names
   - Implemented final marking detection logic
   - Ensured all nodes (including isolated nodes) are included

### Frontend Files

3. **`frontend/src/services/layoutService.js`**
   - Fixed data conversion logic, correctly handle ID, name, isInitialMarking, isFinalMarking
   - Increased node height to accommodate name display
   - Added special layout handling for isolated nodes
   - Handle isolated nodes in both Dagre and Elkjs layouts

## Data Flow Validation

### Test Results (using provided PNML file)

```
=== PARSED NODES ===
Node ID: n1, Name: source 1, Initial: True, Final: False, Tokens: 1
Node ID: n4, Name: middle 4, Initial: False, Final: False, Tokens: 0  # Isolated node
Node ID: n2, Name: sink 2, Initial: False, Final: True, Tokens: 0    # Final marking
Node ID: n3, Name: sink 3, Initial: False, Final: False, Tokens: 0
Node ID: n5, Name: Attended_lecture (transition)
Node ID: n6, Name: Submitted_Assignments (transition)
```

### Verified Functions

- All nodes are parsed (including isolated n4)
- Correct IDs (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6)
- Correct names (source 1, sink 2, middle 4, etc.)
- Correct initial marking (n1 has 1 token)
- Correct final marking (n2 is marked as final)

## Expected Results

The application should now be able to:

1. **Display all nodes**: Including isolated places and transitions
2. **Correct IDs and names**:
   - Display ID inside nodes (e.g., "n1")
   - Display name below nodes (e.g., "source 1")
3. **Special marking display**:
   - Initial marking places: Green border and gradient background
   - Final marking places: Red border and gradient background
4. **Smart connections**:
   - Different connection points
   - Unidirectional arrows
   - Color distinction (input blue, output green)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start backend: `cd backend && ~/miniforge3/bin/python run.py`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Upload the provided `student_learning_process.pnml` file
4. Verify all nodes are displayed, including isolated "middle 4" node
5. Verify "sink 2" displays as final marking (red border)
6. Verify "source 1" displays as initial marking (green border)
